## To create a module in go
$ go mod init example/hello
	- initializes a go.mod files that tracks the dependencies requried for the the code

$ go mod tidy
	- if we add any packages we need to import them in go.mod file. Running above command will do that for us (It will download the requried dependencies)

$ go mod edit -replace example.com/greetings=../greetings
	- to get the package locally
$ go mod tidy
	- to refresh the go.mod file and make the changes. synchronize the example.com/hello module's dependencies

main package and main func are go's starting point 

$ go build
	- to build the package (creates executable file ) (.exe in windows)
	- ./hello or ./hello.exe in windows

$ go list -f '{{.Target}}'
	- to get go installed path

$ set PATH=C:\path\to\your\install\directory

$ go install
	- command to compile and install the package

$ hello
	- to run the package from terminal
